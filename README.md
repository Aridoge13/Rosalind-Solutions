## 📘 What is Rosalind? 
[Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/) is a platform for mastering algorithmic bioinformatics through problem-solving. It spans fundamental topics in computational biology, including:

- DNA/RNA string parsing and manipulation
- Alignment algorithms and edit distance
- Population modeling and dynamic recurrence
- Probability models (Hardy-Weinberg, Mendelian inheritance)
- Tree reconstruction and graph-based genomics

This repository currently contains 48 Python-based solutions, emphasizing clarity, modular logic, and algorithmic design especially in contexts relevant to genomics and systems biology.

## 🧠 Why It Matters
These problems reinforce low-level computational logic behind RNA-seq alignment, mutation detection, and phylogenetic inference. They complement my practical omics work by deepening my ability to:
- Design custom sequence algorithms
- Translate biological rules into recursive or probabilistic models
- Optimize data structures for performance-critical tasks

This blend of first-principles problem solving and pipeline-level implementation makes me better equipped to develop efficient, interpretable omics workflows — especially in high-throughput, splicing-heavy datasets like those used in transcriptional biology.
