## 📘 What is Rosalind? 
[Rosalind] (https://rosalind.info/) is a platform for learning bioinformatics through hands-on problem solving. It presents a series of biologically motivated computational challenges, spanning topics such as:

- DNA/RNA string manipulation
- Sequence alignment
- Genetic code translation
- Population genetics
- Phylogenetic tree construction
- Probability, combinatorics, and dynamic programming in genomics

This repository contains Python-based solutions to a growing set of problems on Rosalind, written for clarity, performance, and educational value.
